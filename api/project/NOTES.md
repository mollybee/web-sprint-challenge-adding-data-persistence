## knexfile.js
this allows referential integrity
cascade (delete everything else that refers to that table) versus restrict (protects data that refers to other data)
this line allows us to set up foreign keys and set up

must add:

pool: {
    afterCreate: (conn, done) => {
        conn.run("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON", done)
    }
}

install knex (google the documentation)
[] npm install knex --save

[] npm install sqlite3 -- save

install eslint
[] npm i eslint

install express
[] npm install express --save

create a knex file
knexfile.js
this creates a knex file with environments
[] knex init

install nodemon
[] npm install --save-dev nodemon

make migration file
[] npx knex migrate:make first-migration

Create db (?)
npx knex migrate:up

seed the migration
[] npx knex seed:run

[] npm install knex-cleaner

npx knex migrate:latest

    1. create tables that done have foreign keys first

    2. then create the ones that do use foreign keys

    3. if you build it first, kill it last
